# Tire-Balancer

## Senior Design Project: Team 62
 Team name: 3DC
 
 Project conducted for: Kennesaw State University
 
This project is for a portable tire balancer. This code relys on a frame structure that is detailed this project that this team designed and built.
The frame uses 3 moment arms to calculate the weight and weight offset to find the center of gravity of the tire mounted.
To ensure the weight offset is accurate, the frame can also self level and take into account the tire number information.

 - Created By: Chance Johnson, Diego Garcia, Daouda Diene, and Destinee Hicks
 
## Features
 - 2 axis Self Leveling
 - 3 point Tire Weighing
 - 3 axis tire CG (Center of gravity) Calculation
 - Capacitive touchscreen for data entering and viewing
 - Tire centering jig
 - Added weight amount and location output
 - Laser guided pointer to required added weight location
 - Automatic/Manual balancing/leveling are prompted to the user
 - User adjustable constants for individual tuning
 - Open Source Design for user firendly modding
 - lightweight & Foldable frame for easy storage
 - Low Energy (relatively) PD2&3/QC2&3 power supply support
 - Safe due to Static/low motion testing
 - Wide range of tire size support
